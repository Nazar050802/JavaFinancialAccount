   - Mediates between domain and infrastructure, enforcing business rules.

3. **Infrastructure Layer:**
   - **Repositories:** `InMemoryRecordRepository`, `InMemoryCategoryRepository`, `InMemoryUserRepository`
   - **Serialization:** `RecordSerializer`
   - Handles data persistence and storage.

4. **User Interface Layer:**

   - Provides a console-based interface for seamless navigation.
